1 What is a naive Bayes classifier in machine learning?
A supervised ml model based on Bayes theorem. It can be implemented on both regression and classification, But it is highly used to predict classification problems.

2 What are the different types of naive Bayes classifier?
- Gaussian
- Mutli-nomial
- Bernoulli 

3 Which type of naive Bayes classifier is best suited for document classification problems?
Multinomial classification.

4. How do you use naive Bayes?
Depending on the problem statement, we can choose the classifier like spam identification, text analytics, etc. It uses the Bayes theorem for prediction.

5. Why do we use a naive Bayes classifier?
An easy and effective way to predict the classification problems and the performance of these models will be better than others and requires less training data.

6 What is CountVectorizer in machine learning?
Creates a feature vector of each sentence and assigns the numerical values based on the occurrence.

7 What is Tfidftransformer used for?
Used to compute the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) values followed by the computation of Tf-IDF scores.
