Day 1 Work with the code

Some of the Topics:

ML: A subset of AI. Letting the machines learn using the data collected or making the machines intelligent.

DS: Having knowledge of Data, collecting the data, cleaning them, and manipulating them so as use them in business problems.

DL: Mimicking human brains and finding a different hidden pattern to act like humans.

Python in ML: It is an easy language and has got many libraries that can be helpful while building Data Science solutions. Apart from Python, R can also be used for the project, whereas Python is preferred due to the easiness of the language.

Google Colab: An online platform where an individual can work on the Data science project and work collaboratively to do any project without installing any required software.

Lifecycle of a Data Science project: It is a way of doing DS projects and various steps involved under it. Following all the modules helps us to create the best solution for the problem statement. Starting with the Business understanding of the issue, Data collection and model evaluation, etc.

Types of ML: 3 Types of ML- Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. Each comprises of different models under them.
