1 What are the Hyperparameters in machine learning?
Hyperparameters are used to control or improve the models. These are the parameters of the models. It varies from model to model. Each model will have its own parameter. 

2 Why Hyperparameter tuning is important?
It helps find the best value of all the parameters of the respective model to improve the accuracy.

3 Which method is used for Hyperparameter tuning?
There are many methods for model tuning. Some of them are GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV, K-Fold, etc.

4 What is the difference between GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV?
Both are used to tune the model to improve the accuracy. The only difference is that the no of parameters combination will be fixed (n_iter), whereas, in GridSearchCV, it varies depending on the no of parameters. GridSearch will try all the combinations of parameters.

5 How do you define a random forest classifier?
The Random forest classifier is a set of decision trees (DT) from a randomly selected subset of the training set. Then the votes are collected from different decision trees to decide the final prediction.

6 Why do we use a random forest classifier?
A random forest classifier is used in classification to prevent the overfitting of the model and to know the importance of the input features.
