Day 2 worked info and code

TOPICS COVERED:
Different data types, Types of object, Indepth info about each types: String- slicing, indexing and different functions under it, Conditional and control statements, loops - While, for loop and various other functionality in loops.

Some of the indepth info of topic:

1 Mutable and Immutable: Under Mutable we have provision to update or change the value of the object whereas in Immutable the state can't be changed.

2 Loop statement: The statement which has to run recursively or when we want to execute certain code for n no of times or for reusability concept.

3 Indentation: It conveys the specific block of code with same indentation, a space will be given at start of the code.

4 Multiple condition: Can be achieved using multiple else-if condition and using various logical operation under it.

5 Pass statement in python: helps to run the empty code.

6 Control statement in python: Continue - goes to the top of the loop by skipping the code below it, Break: used to come out of the loop, Pass-used to write a empty code.
