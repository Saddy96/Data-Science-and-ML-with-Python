1 What are the most practical applications of k-means?
Categorizing into various grades based on their grades like academic performance.

2 What is elbow method?
The method used to find the best-suited value for the no of clusters.

3 How is the elbow method used in clustering?
The point of an elbow is taken as the k value, the point after which the WCSS values are almost the same.

4 How to plot WCSS against an increasing k?
The inertia (distance between the points, the respective centroids, and then squaring them) value is calculated for different values of k starting with 1 and then plotted.

5 What is Seaborn used for?
It is used for data visualization. It has got enhanced features as compared to Matplotlib.

6 What is the difference between Matplotlib and Seaborn?
Both are used for data visualization, where seaborn has got some extra features as compared to matplotlib and the plotting is easy in seaborn.

7 What is hue in Seaborn plots?
To differentiate in the color-coding of the plotted chart.
