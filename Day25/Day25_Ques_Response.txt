1 How do you make an end-to-end machine learning project?
Different steps involved: Problem Identification, Data Gathering, Data Preparation, EDA, Feature Engineering, Feature importance, Fitting and Evaluating different models, saving the model, and then final deployment. 

2 What is feature importance in a decision tree?
To find which all features are critical/important for the models.

3. How do you deploy an ML project?
By creating the required file for the Heroku platform, the required files are procfile, model, requirements file, web UI file, and then deploying it on the cloud.

4. Write your machine learning Project ideas.
Stock prediction, HR analytics, predicts the price of cryptocurrencies (How the crypto will behave - including time series analysis), predicting the failures of aero parts while the airplane is in use.
